  "privacyAndCookiePolicy": "Privacy & Cookie Policy",
  "privacyPolicyIntro": "Your privacy is paramount. DropSilk is architected to be as private as possible. This policy explains what data we process and why.",
  "dataWeDoNotCollect": "1. Data We Do NOT Collect",
  "dataWeDoNotCollectDescription": "We do not collect, store, or have access to the files you transfer or the content of your screen shares. All such data is sent directly from your device to your peer's device using an encrypted, peer-to-peer (P2P) connection.",
  "dataWeProcess": "2. Data We Process to Provide the Service",
  "signalingData": "Signaling Data: To establish a P2P connection, our server temporarily handles technical metadata (like IP addresses and session descriptions). This is essential for connecting you with your peer and is discarded as soon as your session ends. It is never logged or stored.",
  "previewUploads": "Preview Uploads: For certain file types (e.g., .pptx), a preview may be generated by temporarily uploading the file to our secure third-party service, UploadThing. This file is used solely for generating the preview and is automatically deleted. This is optional and only occurs if you click the preview button.",
  "cookiesAndLocalStorage": "3. Cookies & Local Storage",
  "cookiesAndLocalStorageDescription": "We use your browser's `localStorage` for essential functionality and, with your consent, for analytics.",
  "essentialStorage": "Essential Storage: We store your theme preference (e.g., `dropsilk-theme`), onboarding status, and your privacy consent choice. These are necessary for the site to function as you expect.",
  "analyticsWithConsent": "Analytics (with Consent): If you accept, we use Google Analytics to collect anonymous, aggregated usage data (like page visits and feature usage). This helps us understand how the service is used and improve it. This data is not tied to your personal identity.",
  "yourRights": "4. Your Rights (GDPR, CCPA, PDPA)",
  "yourRightsDescription": "You have rights over your data. Since we don't store personal data on our servers, these rights apply to the data on your own device and with our third-party providers.",
  "rightToAccessAndErase": "Right to Access & Erase: You can view and delete all data DropSilk stores on your device by clearing your browser's cache and site data.",
  "rightToWithdrawConsent": "Right to Withdraw Consent: You can withdraw your consent for analytics at any time by clearing your browser's site data for dropsilk.xyz. The consent banner will reappear on your next visit.",
  "rightToDoNotSell": "Right to \"Do Not Sell\" (CCPA): We do not sell your personal information.",

  "googleRecaptcha": "Google reCAPTCHA: For spam protection on our contact details.",
  "renderAndVercel": "Render & Vercel: For hosting our backend and frontend, respectively.",
  "uploadThing": "UploadThing: For hosting optional file previews. You will be asked to reaffirm consent for this before we upload your file. Your file will be deleted from our UploadThing account by our server's automatic cleanup service within 24 hours of its upload. You may reach out to us via our contact page if you require immediate deletion.",
  "microsoft": "Microsoft: For rendering complex formats and specifically PPTX previews via the Online Office Document Previewer.",
  "thirdPartyServicesReview": "We encourage you to review their respective privacy policies.",
  "securityByDesign": "Security by Design",
  "endToEndEncryption": "End-to-End Encryption",
  "endToEndEncryptionDescription": "All data transferred between you and your peer, including files and screen shares, is encrypted end-to-end using industry-standard WebRTC protocols (DTLS and SRTP). This means the data is encrypted on the sender's device and can only be decrypted by the recipient's device. No one in between—not even the DropSilk server—can access the contents of your transfer.",
  "noCloudStorageRisk": "No Cloud Storage Risk",
  "noCloudStorageRiskDescription": "Your files are never uploaded to or stored on a central server. The transfer happens directly between the browsers of the connected peers. This eliminates the risk of a traditional cloud data breach exposing your files, as there is no central repository to attack.",
  "ephemeralSessions": "Ephemeral Sessions",
  "ephemeralSessionsDescription": "Each \"flight\" is a temporary, private session. The connection information is held by our server only for the duration of the session. Once you or your peer disconnects, the session is terminated and the connection data is discarded.",
  "yourResponsibility": "Your Responsibility",
  "yourResponsibilityDescription": "While we provide a secure channel, your security also depends on you. Always ensure you are sharing files with a person you know and trust. We recommend verifying the flight code with them through a separate, secure channel (like a private message) before initiating a transfer.",
  "frequentlyAskedQuestions": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "fileSizeLimit": "Is there a file size limit?",
  "fileSizeLimitDescription": "Theoretically, no. DropSilk is designed to handle large files by streaming them directly. However, performance for extremely large files (many gigabytes) can be affected by your device's memory capacity and the stability of your network connection.",
  "slowTransferSpeed": "Why is my transfer speed slow?",
  "slowTransferSpeedDescription": "Transfer speed is determined by the direct network path between you and your peer. For the fastest speeds, ensure both devices are on the same local Wi-Fi network (LAN). When transferring over the internet (WAN), the speed is limited by the slowest of the two users' internet connections (specifically, the sender's upload speed and the receiver's download speed).",
  "isDropSilkFree": "Is DropSilk free to use?",
  "isDropSilkFreeDescription": "Yes, DropSilk is completely free. It was created as a passion project to offer a simple and private file sharing solution.",
  "supportedBrowsers": "What browsers are supported?",
  "supportedBrowsersDescription": "DropSilk works on all modern, up-to-date desktop browsers that fully support WebRTC, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari. DropSilk may look slightly different on some browsers due to the way they choose to interpret certain parts of the CSS spec. This does not affect functionality and is purely aesthetic.",
  "whatHappensIfDisconnected": "What happens if I get disconnected?",
  "whatHappensIfDisconnectedDescription": "If your network connection is interrupted, the file transfer will stop. You will need to reconnect to the flight and restart the transfer for any incomplete files. There is currently no functionality to resume a failed transfer. Fully received files will remain accessible and downloadable until you close the tab.",
  "howDoesScreenSharingWork": "How does screen sharing work?",
  "howDoesScreenSharingWorkDescription": "Screen sharing uses the same secure, peer-to-peer WebRTC technology as file transfers. Your screen is streamed directly to your peer, and is never visible to our servers.",
