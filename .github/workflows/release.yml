# This workflow runs when you push a tag that looks like a version number (e.g., v1.0.0)
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "v*.*.*"

jobs:
  build-and-release:
    # We use macos-latest because it's the only way to build for all three
    # platforms (Win, Mac, Linux) in one go with electron-builder.
    runs-on: macos-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the code from your repository
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up pnpm. We're not in npm land anymore, Toto.
      - name: Setup pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
        with:
          version: 10 # Or whatever major version you use

      # Step 3: Set up the correct Node.js version
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"

          # Note the path points inside your frontend directory!
          cache: "pnpm"
          cache-dependency-path: "frontend/pnpm-lock.yaml"

      # Step 4: Install dependencies using pnpm
      # THIS IS THE KEY PART! We tell this step to run inside the /frontend folder.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
        working-directory: ./frontend

      # Step 5: Run the build script
      # We run the build command from inside /frontend as well.
      # The `-- --publish always` part is crucial. The first `--` separates
      # pnpm arguments from the script's arguments. The `--publish always` tells
      # electron-builder to prepare the artifacts for a release.
      - name: Build application
        run: pnpm run build:electron -- --publish always

          # that allows electron-builder to interact with the GitHub API.
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      # Step 6: Create the GitHub Release and upload the built files
      # This action automatically finds the tag, creates a release, and uploads
      # the files for you. It's fucking magic.
